### What went well?

Retrieving data from Twitter and Basilica went well.


### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topics today?

Learning that we can store pickle objects in sqlalchemy was very interesting.


### What was the most challenging part of the work today?

Interpreting the twitter data was difficult. There was a field in the tweet objects that
was called "text" in some places and "fulltext" in others. The documentation was not
very good.
